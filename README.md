## About BHFMEF Quantitative and Qualitative Experimental Results：

The prevalent quantitative evaluation metric for multi-exposure image fusion in computer vision involves comparing the fusion results with under-exposed and over-exposed images.

Therefore, If you want to get the best quantitative results, it would be better to set the weights of the calculated fusion image and each source image in MEFloss.py to **0.5, 0, 0, 0.5**. If you want to get the best qualitative results, the above weights are set to **0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25** might be better.
